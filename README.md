## Description
Communication and content presents a comprehensive and foundational account of meaning based on new versions of situation theory and game theory. The literal and implied meanings of an utterance are derived from first principles assuming little more than the partial rationality of interacting agents. New analyses of a number of diverse phenomena – a wide notion of ambiguity encompassing phonetics, syntax, semantics, pragmatics, and beyond, vagueness, convention and  conventional meaning, Frege’s puzzle of informative identities, semantic change, translation, and definitions of communication, speaker meaning, and reference – are developed. Frege’s context and compositional principles are generalized and reconciled in a fixed point principle and a detailed critique of Grice and some aspects of the Romantic conception of meaning are offered. The book will be of interest to scholars in philosophy, linguistics, artificial intelligence, and cognitive science. It should also interest readers in related fields like literary and art criticism and those involved in applications of game theory to other fields.
