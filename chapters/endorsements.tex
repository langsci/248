\addchap{Praise for this book}

\noindent This book is the culmination of Prashant Parikh's long and deep work on fundamental questions of language and how they can be illuminated by game-theoretic analysis.\medskip\\
— Roger Myerson, 2007 Nobel Laureate in Economics, University of Chicago\bigskip\\

\noindent Prashant Parikh has made fundamental contributions to the game-theoretic analysis of linguistic meaning. \textit{Communication and content} summarizes and extends this important work, offering a truly novel approach to the strategic foundations of meaning. This approach finds a way out of the prison of methodological solipsism and opens up the study of linguistic meaning to scientific study.\medskip\\
— Robin Clark, Linguistics, University of Pennsylvania\bigskip\\

\noindent\textit{Communication and content} is the crowning achievement of a long line of research pioneered by Prashant Parikh. In this groundbreaking work Parikh introduces a fresh perspective on natural language pragmatics, by making a creative tie with game theory. Clearly written, \textit{Communication and content} weaves together semantics, game theory, and situation theory to create a thought-pro\-vok\-ing picture of natural language pragmatics. Every modern AI researcher interested in the foundations of natural language pragmatics owes it to him- or herself to become familiar with this picture.\medskip\\
