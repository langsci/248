This book owes more to John Perry, Dan Flickinger, and Ennio Stacchetti than I can possibly express. 

In addition to his own invaluable comments, John organized an informal multinational seminar at Stanford University conducted over Skype whose members---Eros Corazza,  Maria de Ponte, Kepa Korta, JJ Lang, Fenrong Liu, and especially Dan---provided extremely useful feedback. My grateful thanks to them all.

Ennio discussed and also contributed to the game-theoretic model I was developing over multiple conversations at New York University. I give him my everlasting thanks.

I would also like to thank Joel Sobel and Navin Kartik with whom I had an extended email interaction. I am grateful as well to game theorists Ken Binmore and Vincent Crawford, both of whom provided useful comments.

Over the years, I have had interesting exchanges with and would like to thank Kent Bach, Anton Benz, Joan Bresnan, Nelson Correa, Michael Devitt, Fred Dretske, Dagfinn F{\o}llesdal, Joe Halpern, James Hampton, Larry Horn, Gerhard J\"{a}ger, Gregory Murphy, Stephen Neale, Daniel Osherson, Rohit Parikh, Liina Pylkk\"{a}nen, Fran\c{c}ois Recanati, Herb Terrace, Tom Wasow, Deirdre Wilson, Terry Winograd, and Ed Zalta.

My deepest debt is to my parents Jagdish and Shaila, my wife Avani, and my son Neal. Without Avani, this book would never have come to be.
